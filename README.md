### Hi there, I'm Sakal ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Brisbane based software engineering student who recently completed the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly. I'm currently pursuing a career in software development.
### About me :eyes:
My background is in electronics but ever since I got a taste of software programming, I've been hooked and have been doing it ever since. I first learned assembly and C years ago, but my main experience lies with Javascript, Ruby and Python.
### What I'm working on :rocket:
* :snowman: Snowcast - A front-end application that allows users to check the snowfall forecast at various ski resorts. Deployed to AWS. Try it out here: [**http://snowcast.co**](https://snowcast.co)
### Check out my previous projects ðŸ‘€
* :video_game: [tic-tac-toe](https://sakalmon.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) - A classic two player game of tic-tac-toe.
* :cocktail: [bartender](https://bartender.fly.dev/) - A full-stack application that allows users to search for cocktail recipes as well as post their own.
* :dagger: [sprite-knight](https://github.com/sakalmon/sprite-knight) - A group collaboration project. A Single Page Application RPG game with a pixelated theme. Fight, explore and level up!
### What I'm currently learning :books:
* Java
* TypesScript
### Fun fact :zap:
Javascript was written in 10 days!
