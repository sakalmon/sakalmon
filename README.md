### Hi there, I'm Sakal ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Brisbane based software engineering student, currently studying Software Engineering at General Assembly, set to graduate in Feb 2023. From there, I will be pursuing my career in software development.
### About me :eyes:
My background is in electronics but ever since I got a taste of software programming, I've been hooked and have been doing it ever since. I first learned assembly and C years ago, but my main experience lies with Javascript and Python, which I later learned.
### What I'm working on :video_game:
A 2 player tic-tac-toe game. Try it out [**here.**](https://sakalmon.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)
### What I'm currently learning :books:
* Ruby
* React
* Angular
### Fun fact :zap:
Javascript was written in 10 days!
